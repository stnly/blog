It is the end of week 2 in uni now. Lessons have started to get into the main content. I'm going to keep a log of the things I was taught in the week. It will serve as a way for me to reflect and revise the content. I am currently taking 5 courses and they are, COMP1927 - Computing 2, MATH1081 - Discrete Mathematics, ENG1000 - Design and Innovation, COMP2111 - System Modelling and Design, SENG2010 - Software Engineering Workshop 2A.

For COMP1927, we basically revised on C memory model, how the code, global data, heap and stack work together. Basic data structures (linked lists), recursion vs iteration, basic algorithms. Touched a little bit on the Big-Oh notation which I was looking forward to, and a little bit on the importance of complexity analysis. 

Quick tip. In the final exam, we are to create a linked list from the command line and know how to free a linked list. The key is to remember the link so that you can go forwards or backwards in the list. We will also be given a function and find its complexity. Just remember that if it is a member of the quadratic class, it is automatically a member of all classes.

Lab02 was easy enough, but I at least I know that the syntax would not be the one that is holding me back. We had to create 4 programs that specify certain requirements. I will post the requirements and solutions on my Github after the submission deadline so no one will be able to copy the answers.

MATH1081 was easy enough during the first two weeks. It was about Sets, Functions, Sequences and Series. The different laws that were associated with sets, Distributive laws, Associative laws, DeMorgan’s law, Commutative law, Absorbtion Law, Idempotent law, Identity law, Difference law and Domination law. There is also the double complement law, universal bound law and intersection and union with complement law. These laws are the basis of Boolean Algebra are identical to laws for logic gates (AND/OR/NAND/NOR) and truth tables.

Functions. There are 3 kinds of functions, injective, surjective and bijective. Surjective: f:X->Y then f is onto/surjective <=> range of f=y=codomain of f <=> for every y:Y there is some x:X with f(x)=y. Injective: f:X->Y then f is 1:1/injective <=> no two elements x , x’:X gets sent to the same y:Y <=> if f(x)=f(x’) then x=x’. A function is bijective when it is both surjective and injective.

It was just and introduction to sequences and series today. Where we learnt about the various sequences, and that a series is the summation of a sequence. 

ENGG1000 revolves around project management and group work. It did not really matter if we did a project out of our field. I chose to do robotics and was quite pleased with what we are supposed to do. We will be coding a LEGO NXT robot to do a certain task. My target for this course is to learn more project management skills rather than coding. The classes have not started yet though.

COMP2111’s lecturer in charge is also our program director. In this course, we are learning how to use the evolution of B method, Event B. It is a design process for robust software. Using mathematical formulas we can prove that our program is going to work even before writing a single line of code. Learning about Event B is the key difference between hackers, computer scientists and software engineers. That is why we are able to engineer software before implementation. Event B is great, but the IDE  and editor that we use, Rodin, is not. So sadly, it is quite hard to get everything working. But so far, I’m getting a good feeling of it.

SENG2010 is a software engineering workshop that is piggybacking on COMP2111. We have to engineer software using Event B. This is a group project course and although we have not really started, I am looking forward to it. In the next semester, we will actually be implementing this design and have a fully functional something. Last year’s SENG workshop, the teams created a ticket booking webapp and the winning team gets AUD$2,000. Our group’s goal is to do something epic this year and win that money.
