For those in the know, I have shifted back home for around a month now. 

Before moving out, I threw away tonnes of stuff that just sat in my cupboard untouched for years. Those with significant sentimental value, I took a photo of it and tossed the actual item away. After moving back in and unpacking, I realised I don't miss them at all. 

Clearing my possessions and finding out what I actually use on a daily basis, will help me plan my packing and assist my move to Sydney. I will learn to live with less.
