I spent a year reducing and simplifying my usage of social networks like Facebook, Twitter, etc. I learned that I mainly used Facebook to simplify meets with large groups of friends. Close friends would be receiving a call or message to request for a meets instead of a Facebook invite. Twitter is used for casual link sharing or for quick interaction. Important or serious topics are discussed digitally through e-mail or instant messaging. But I still prefer meets for such topics.

Stack exchange or quora is preferred for asking questions to a hive mind rather than these social networks. They tend to be less biased because there is no relationship involved. Unless there is a level of trust required then I'll use these social networks. As of now, I have no easy way to share links or bookmarks between friends, currently done through e-mail or IM, therefore I am thinking of signing up for Pinboard to be able to save and share bookmarks in the cloud.
